# Code for simulating the granular and stochastic addition of radioisotopes to an abstract zone of the galaxy
### Created by Andrés Yagüe López and Benoit Côté.
### This code is both python3 and FORTRAN90. The f90 code can be run with mpi and it is parallelized.

# Input
Data is needed as tEvents.in file. Please refer to the README.md file in the database/ directory to use the code get_tEvents_box.py, which can generate a file that can be then renamed to tEvents.in for use by the code.

A prodFactor.in file must exist. It should either contain two "ones" separated by a single space in the first line ("1 1"), or have the same format as the tEvents.in file, where each event has its own production factor.

# How to run
After compiling the *.f90 files, one can follow the steps detailed in runExperiments.sh. If run using that script, it will default to use 10 CPU.

# Analysis
We provide some python scripts to analyse the output generated by the code in the stats/ directory.
* extract_data.py: plots the evolution and histogram of a ratio of two isotopes, also creates the *.npy files for "extract_stats.py".
* extract_stats.py: extracts several useful statistics, such as the median and the spread from the *.npy files.
* get_stat.py: creates *.npy files with useful statistics for a single isotope.
* plot_data.py: plots the evolution of a single isotope.
